NO5,500.0,Unknown,2025-09-25T12:42:22Z,New information: Statnetts project to replace the old 300 kV line between Sogndal and Aurland 1 with a new 420 kV is delayed. New estimation is that the project will be done on Thursday 2th of October.   Statnetts project to replace the old 300 kV line between Sogndal and Aurland 1 with a new 420 kV has good progress. Our estimate is that the new line will be in operation with increased market capacity from September 26th. This will relieve a significant bottleneck in flowbased capacity calculation and increase the capacity southwards over Sognefjorden varying between 250 to 500 MW limited by a thermal constraint. The increased capacity will allow a higher production in the area around and north of Sognefjorden. Statnett expect that the power transfer still will be limited by our lines further south in NO5 and Gudbrandsdalen

NO2,900.0,Unknown,2021-10-18T11:45:45Z,"Statnett refer to earlier information about general work to increase the efficiency in ramping restrictions on HVDC in steps.

The restriction has been 300MW/hour for the Day Ahead and Intraday market since the start of operation in December 2020. Statnett is still facing a situation where ramping from HVDC interconnectors connected to NO2 need to be restricted, but changes are now made to split the individual restrictions more evenly between the different Interconnectors.  Statnett and TenneT has agreed to increase the allowed hourly ramping for NordLink to 600MW/hour from November 10th2021 and will in addition implement a combined ramping restriction for NorNed and NordLink of 900MW/hour. At the same time the restriction for the Skagerrak interconnector will be changed from 600MW/hour to 450MW/hour."

The restriction has been 300MW/hour since the start of operation in December 2020. The intention was to gain experience with how this new interconnector would influence system operations in Southern Norway before the allowed total ramping for HVDC interconnectors to NO2 was raised. Due to the flow patterns this winter and that NorNed have been out of operation for a longer period, we have had very few situations where the system has been tested as planned. We therefor need to extend the test period and the period with maximum 300MW/hour for NordLink. A new evaluation will be done in June."

Total import capacity will usually be well below this level, as southbound flows to NO1 and NO5 may be expected.  https://umm.nordpoolgroup.com/#/messages/0fac436c-5486-4852-8a70-f2eef0ab3a0a/1"
